        <h2 class="user-name">John Jacobs</h2>
        <p class="user-bio">He knows the secrets of the universe and the mundane details of every life, a man whose mind is a library of all that
        ever was and will be. His gaze holds the weight of all knowledge, yet he wears it with the quiet grace of someone who
        understands that the most profound wisdom is often found in the simplest truths.</p>
